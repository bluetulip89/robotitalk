# Introduction #

This is the roadmap for RobotiTalk


# Immediate Future #
The following features will be added within the coming month or so.

## Application ##
  * **Installer** - An installer to install RobotiTalk, sample robots, and pre-requisites.
  * **Sample Robots** - Sample robots, both the IRobot derived class, plus Arduino/Parallax code to integrate.
  * **Sample Custom UI** - Sample custom UI for communicating with a robot.

## Docs ##
  * **Complete Wiki** - Documentation for all the major aspects of RobotiTalk

# Long-term Goals #
Long-term, I'd like to include RobotiTalk into RobotiStudio, which will provide an interface manage, build, and upload sketches to the micro-controller, so that you can have a seamless workflow when building multiple prototypes.
