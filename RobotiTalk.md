# What is RobotiTalk? #

RobotiTalk is a simple application to talk to serial based micro-controllers (the heart of man DIY robots). It's not unlike the serial monitor built into Arduino's Sketch Editor, or Parallax's Basic Stamp Editor. However, unlike those, RobotiTalk provides a platform for building GUI interfaces that can be used to communicate with, control, and process information from the micro-controllers in a much more sophisticated way.

Out of the box, it comes with a raw serial communication GUI that allows you to send commands to your micro-controller, and receive data back. You can configure multiple "robots" (or micro-controllers) and switch back and forth between them and monitor and send instructions to them.
