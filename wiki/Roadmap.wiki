#summary RobotiTalk future plans

= Introduction =

This is the roadmap for RobotiTalk


= Immediate Future =
The following features will be added within the coming month or so.

== Application ==
  * *Installer* - An installer to install RobotiTalk, sample robots, and pre-requisites.
  * *Sample Robots* - Sample robots, both the IRobot derived class, plus Arduino/Parallax code to integrate.
  * *Sample Custom UI* - Sample custom UI for communicating with a robot.

== Docs ==
  * *Complete Wiki* - Documentation for all the major aspects of RobotiTalk

= Long-term Goals =
Long-term, I'd like to include RobitiTalk into RobotiStudio, which will provide an interface manage, build, and upload sketches to the micro-controller, so that you can have a seamless workflow when building multiple prototypes.
