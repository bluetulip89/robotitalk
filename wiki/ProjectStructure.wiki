#summary Overview of the project structure of the source code

= Introduction =
The project is a Visual Studio 2008 project. The solution file contains several projects:
* Sicily.Robotix.MicroController
* Sicily.Robotix.RobotiTalk
* Sicily.Robotix.Robots
* Sicily.WPF.Validators

== Sicily.Robotix.MicroController ==
The main base classes. Includes IRobot, RobotBase, RobotConfiguration, etc. If you're creating your own IRobot class, you'll need to reference this assembly/project.

== Sicily.Robotix.RobotiTalk ==
The actual WPF application. Contains all the windows, controls, etc. 

== Sicily.Robotix.Robots ==
Contains the built-in robots that derive from IRobot. 

== Sicily.WPF.Validators ==
Contains WPF validators. Will probably be deleted, since I'm not using them.
